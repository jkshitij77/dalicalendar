# DaliCalendar

#### This project was created for 'DALI WebDev Mini Course' by team 'HTMLMAO'
#### This is not a solo project and has been heavily collaborated upon with Makayla Dixon, Eleanor Amer and Sarah Colin - May 2020

HTMLMAO is a team of Dartmouth students. We found the need for a calendar which made keeping track of club events easier for Dartmouth students. In response, we built this website as an initial prototype.

I personally plan to work on this and make it a more comrehensive and interactive website with the otpion to add club events, make club IDs and Individual IDs, link with DUO to make sure the said person is a Dartmouth student. Possible, we will implement the said features in a flutter rendition of the project to make a mobile application at the same time

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
